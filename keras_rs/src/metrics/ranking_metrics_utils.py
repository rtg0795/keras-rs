    """Computes per-list weights from provided sample weights.

    Per-list weights are calculated as follows:
    ```
    per_list_weights = sum(weights * relevance) / sum(relevance).
    ```

    For lists where the sum of relevance is 0, a default weight is assigned:
    ```
    sum(per_list_weights) / num(sum(relevance) != 0 AND sum(weights) != 0)
    ```

    If all lists have a sum of relevance equal to 0, the default weight is 1.0.

    As a result of the above computation, this function takes care of the
    following cases:
    - **Uniform Weights:** When all input weights are 1.0, all per-list weights
      will be 1.0, even for lists with no relevant examples. This aligns with
      standard ranking metrics.
    - **Non-zero Weights per List:** If every list has at least one non-zero
      weight, the default weight mechanism is not utilized, which is suitable
      for unbiased metrics.
    - **Mixed Scenarios:** For cases with a mix of lists having zero and
      non-zero relevance and weights, the weights for lists with non-zero
      relevance and weights are proportional to:

      ```
      per_list_weights / sum(per_list_weights) *
